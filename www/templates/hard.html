        A Hard Lockdown is an emergency lockdown response to an actual emergency situation within the building,  on school grounds, or immediate surroundings of the school. This type of lockdown requires that all staff and students seek as much safety from physical assault as possible by using barriers to sight (hiding behind/away from/beneath) as well as physical barriers. This procedure requires immediate, evasive action on the part of students and staff, and it rapidly enhances the level of security in the building.
