    <div class="content-wrapper">
      <p class="desc">
        A Soft Lockdown occurs when an outside event or actual threat near the building requires security actions to take place, but instruction continues as normal. Soft Lockdown is a preventative response to rapidly enhance the level of security within the building. In this type of lockdown, all exterior doors and main interior doors are locked, making it more difficult for an intruder to enter the building or gain access to students, but staff and students can continue with productive activities in a limited fashion.
