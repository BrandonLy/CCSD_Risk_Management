        Evacuation is the movement of all students and staff out of the facility as quickly and orderly as possible. This movement is initiated when there is a threat in or near the facility and it is safer for students to move away from the building rather than remaining. Typically, students and staff will move to the designated Staff-Student Staging Area. At this location, attendance is taken and decisions can be made as to whether there will be movement to the Family Reunification Site or return to the school.
