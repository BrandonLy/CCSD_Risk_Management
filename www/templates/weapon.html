        During use, processing or transporting of radioactive materials, accidents may occur that will expose the facility to the dangers of contaminants. In this situation, the chances of illness are decreased when people know what to do and how to protect themselves. In addition, individuals or groups could cause the release of radioactive materials through a variety of means including an explosive device designed to scatter radioactive materials (commonly referred to as a “dirty bomb”), the scattering or distribution of radiological materials without the use of explosives, or the use of a nuclear device. Of these scenarios, the use of a “dirty bomb” or scattering or distribution of radiological materials is more likely scenarios. Radiological materials could be disseminated via food or water supply.
